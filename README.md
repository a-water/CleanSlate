# CleanSlate
An OS X app that allows you to show/hide your desktop items with a single click!
I was only able to test on 10.10 Yosemite, if anyone has issues on any previous version of OS X let me know.

# How it works
This app is basically a wrapper around the terminal command "defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop".
Right click the menu bar icon to access the menu.

# Can I contribute?
Absolutely! My inital version is very basic, meaning there is plenty of room for improvements. Feel free to submit a pull request!

# Special Thanks
1. A lot of code inspiration was borrowed from https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake.
2. Also thanks to https://github.com/Mozketo/LaunchAtLoginController and https://github.com/biocross/LaunchAtLoginController--with-ARC- for simplifying things.
3. Another thanks to artworkbean and thenounproject for the icon!
