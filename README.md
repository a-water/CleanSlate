# CleanSlate
An OS X app that allows you to show/hide your desktop items with a single click! 

# How it works
This app is basically a wrapper around the terminal command "defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop"

# Can I contribute?
Absolutely! My inital version is very basic, meaning there is plenty of room for improvements. Feel free to submit a pull request!

# Special Thanks
A lot of code inspiration was borrowed from https://github.com/newmarcel/KeepingYouAwake.
Also thanks to https://github.com/Mozketo/LaunchAtLoginController and https://github.com/biocross/LaunchAtLoginController--with-ARC- for simplifying things.
